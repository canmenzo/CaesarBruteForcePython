# CaesarCipherPython
Caesar cipher encryption and brute-force decryption utilizing Python.

This repository contains two Python scripts for Caesar cipher encryption and decryption.
The Caesar cipher is a simple substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of positions down or up the alphabet.
The Encryption script allows you to encrypt an inputted message using the Caesar cipher with a user-determined key and output to a file.
The decryption script allows you to decrypt a message that has been encrypted with a key by brute-forcing.
